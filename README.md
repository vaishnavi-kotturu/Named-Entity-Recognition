# Named-Entity-Recognition

The dataset used is [CoNLL 2003](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/) from nltk text corpora. Trained word embeddings using Word2Vec's Skip-Gram model and created a window-based classification Network in Python for learning Named Entity classes.
Optimized the performance by using Casing feature vector and weighted cross-entropy loss to handle Class imbalanced data.
